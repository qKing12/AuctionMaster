#Let the plugin know what currency you want to use
#for your player's auctions

#Put 'Vault' for Vault Currency(Default)
#Put 'TokenManager' for TokenManager Currency
#Put 'PlayerPoints' for PlayerPoints Currency
#Put 'CustomEconomy-Balance' for CustomEconomy Balance Mode
#Put 'CustomEconomy-Tokens' for CustomEconomy Tokens Mode
#Put 'Skript' for Skript Currency
#If you misspell the currency type, it will automatically select Vault
currency-type: 'Vault'

#If your currency does not work the auction won't either
#There are two possible errors:
#Error 404 = The currency plugin is missing
#Error 505 = The player's currency is unreachable (Frequently caused by undeclared/misspelled skript variables)

#----------- Skript Configuration -----------
#Use %player% for player's name
#The variable should be like in skript but without braces
#Example: {balance.%player%} would be balance.%player%
skript-variable: 'balance::%player%'
